This is an add-on board for the [Squareatron 5000 v1.1](https://github.com/OregonIons/Squareatron-5000) ultra low-noise ion trap RF supply. 

It works by trimming the precision 3.3V supply voltage of the limiting amplifier on the Squareatron 5000.  It provides a tuning range of 3.15-3.45 V without adding significant noise.  The Jupyter notebook included provides a noise model.

A prototype board currently being fabricated and testing will follow.
